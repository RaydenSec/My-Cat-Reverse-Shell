# My-Cat-Reverse-Shell

A python reverse shell like program, not really..., that I coded at the end of year 12 in 2021 using mainly sockets. This is a test project that I have uploaded onto GitHub to test how Github works. Btw, this project is not completely finished, and has a few bugs as I haven't been bothered fixing it yet... (eg. Can only copy images over from other computers, not txt files, probably due to an incorrect implementation of the byte transfer function, I'll fix it later :) ) 

How to Use: 
1. Make sure to change the target IP to your target's IP address (target needs to be on the same network as you) 
2. Ensure python3 is installed on target's laptop (check with python3 --version) 
3. Make sure you kitty.py is running on your computer, it'll act as a listener (like a server) 
4. Run paw.py on target client's laptop using - python3 paw.py (I haven't made this an .exe file yet :( ) 
5. Execute your desired commands to navigate directories on target computers, and copy images/simple text files 
6. Have fun! 

Hack away :D
